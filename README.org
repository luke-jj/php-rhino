** Quick Start
To get started quickly simply require or include one of the =rhino.php= files 
located in the base or lib/ folder of this framework in the =index.php= file
of your application.

You can then call the exported =rhino()= function to instantiate this 
framework's main application and assign the return to a variable 
- conventionally named =$app=.
  
#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php

require_once './lib/rhino.php';

$app = rhino();
#+END_SRC

See the =examples/= folder more complete working prototype applications.
